# FRCdle

A browser game based on the NY Times game Wordle, made for FIRST Robotics Competition students at GRITS, an off-season FRC competition in Georgia. Our initial goal was to go teach students in FRC about the teams in their district, and expose lesser known teams to the spotlight. 

As an afterthought, we want to show students how easy is to start making a website, even with little to no prior experience! (or any side project!)
